# Code-Defined Agent Skills Sample

This sample demonstrates how to create **Agent Skills** in Python code, without needing `SKILL.md` files on disk.

## What are Code-Defined Skills?

While file-based skills use `SKILL.md` files discovered on disk, code-defined skills let you define skills entirely in Python using `AgentSkill` and `AgentSkillResource` classes. Two patterns are shown:

1. **Basic Code Skill** — Create an `AgentSkill` directly with static resources (inline content)
2. **Dynamic Resources** — Attach callable resources via the `@skill.resource` decorator that generate content at invocation time

Both patterns can be combined with file-based skills in a single `AgentSkillsProvider`.

## Running the Sample

### Prerequisites
- An [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) project with a deployed model (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`)

### Environment Variables

Set the required environment variables in a `.env` file (see `python/.env.example`):

- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`: Your Azure AI Foundry project endpoint
- `AZURE_OPENAI_RESPONSES_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`: The name of your model deployment (defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`)

### Authentication

This sample uses `AzureCliCredential` for authentication. Run `az login` in your terminal before running the sample.

### Run

```bash
cd python
uv run samples/02-agents/skills/code_skill/code_skill.py
```

### Examples

The sample runs two examples:

1. **Code style question** — Uses Pattern 1 (static resources): the agent loads the `code-style` skill and reads the `style-guide` resource to answer naming convention questions
2. **Project info question** — Uses Pattern 2 (dynamic resources): the agent reads dynamically generated `environment` and `team-roster` resources
