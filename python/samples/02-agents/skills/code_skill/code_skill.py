Code-Defined Agent Skills — Define skills in Python code

This sample demonstrates how to create Agent Skills in code,
without needing SKILL.md files on disk. Two patterns are shown:

Pattern 1: Basic Code Skill
  Create an AgentSkill instance directly with static resources (inline content).

Pattern 2: Dynamic Resources
  Create an AgentSkill and attach callable resources via the @skill.resource
  decorator. Resources can be sync or async functions that generate content at
  invocation time.

Both patterns can be combined with file-based skills in a single AgentSkillsProvider.

                ## General Rules
                - Use 4-space indentation (no tabs)
                - Maximum line length: 120 characters
                - Use type annotations on all public functions
                - Use Google-style docstrings

                ## Naming Conventions
                - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., UserAccount)
                - Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., get_user_name)
                - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_RETRIES)
                - Private members: prefix with underscore (e.g., _internal_state)
